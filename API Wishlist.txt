Please note:
	As a World of Warcraft addon developer I *VERY OFTEN* refer to WoW-related stuff, because that's what I'm used to.

Game Events
	ADD Shitload of events (http://wowprogramming.com/docs/events)

Control Events
	FIX MouseButtonUp // self.wndMain:AddEventHandler("MouseButtonUp", "OnMouseClick", self);
	ADD MouseButtonClick
	FIX MouseWheel // Camera shouldn't change zoom level when using the mousewheel on a window that also has a MouseWheel event handler (I think there are more events affected by this)

Unit
	ADD GetCastingSpell
	ADD GetCastingSpellId
	ADD GetCastingSpellIcon
	FIX GetBuffs - fTimeRemaining doesn't change when a buff is refreshed (tested with Deadly Chain)
	FIX GetBuffs - Some debuffs aren't in the array (like Frostbitten Chill, Coldburrow Cavern low body temp debuff), same issue with buffs.

MLWindow
	ADD DT_SINGLELINE
	ADD DT_WORDBREAK

	(Or just add coloring to every text like it works in WoW, this would make it stupid easy.)

Spell
	ADD GetBuffTooltip/GetBuffFlavor/GetBuffSpell (whatever, just something like that)

Threat
	ADD Data for everyone.

Others
	Slash /CoMMandS should be case insensitive!
	Add a way to create a unit tooltip.
	Allow us to map a keybindings to a macro (or change actionbutton content, I think we're able to set keybindings for them).
	Addon settings for addons with invalid characters (like ":") in their Name in toc.xml won't get saved/loaded (Apollo.GetAddonInfo() works when removing the invalid characters).
